# SticksAI

This is an implementation of the classic hand game **Sticks** (also known as Chopsticks) with an **AI opponent** that uses **Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning**.

## 📜 Rules

- Each player has two hands.
- Each hand starts with 1 stick.
- On your turn, you can:
  - **Attack Left**: Tap the opponent’s left or right hand with your left or right hand, adding your sticks to theirs.
  - **Attack Right**: Same as above, but targeting the opposite hand.
  - **Bump**: Redistribute your sticks between your own hands according to legal bump rules.
- If any hand reaches 5 sticks, it is reset to 0.
- If both hands are 0, that player loses.

## 🤖 Features

- Human vs AI gameplay.
- User chooses who goes first.
- Multiple difficulty levels:
  - **beginner**: depth 2
  - **rookie**: depth 5
  - **intermediate**: depth 10
  - **pro**: depth 15
  - **all-star**: depth 20
  - **genius**: depth 25
- Cycle detection — prevents infinite loops by declaring a draw if a state repeats.

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python sticks_game.py
📌 How to Play
